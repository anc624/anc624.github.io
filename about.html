<p> There I was, cold and alone, unable yet to see or walk....nestled in a pile of leaves, singing whatever tune was stuck in my head
....when my saviors showed up and rescued me! Not only did they save me from the bitter cold that night, 
Scott and Angie Shuck opened their hearts and home to me...fed me and kept me warm, fostering me with their children and dog, Reece. 
I grew quickly, gained my strength and tons of social skills!!! Before we knew it I was ready for my forever home. </p>

At 3 months old I was adopted into the most wonderful family.  I came to my forever home and met my 2 dog siblings, 2 cat siblings and<strong><u> 6 HUMANS!!!! </u></strong>
And bonus....my foster family gets to visit all the time!
I am soooo lucky, really am living the life... I have my very own cat hamock, a magical never ending bowl of food and my very own side of the bed!!! 
I am oh so grateful for the kindness of my rescuer, the care of my fosters and the commiment of my adoptive family. 
They claim loving kitties is in their dna....that they are the decendants of the most amazing, generous, pet loving, lady ever!
I sure am glad she passed along her love for animals to her children and grandchildren!

</p>
<p> <i>So in the Pet Loving Memory of Mommaw Rayla, and in an effort to show my gratitude and appreciation to my own and all the foster 
			 and adoptive families out there, 
			 I respectfully solicit your money....for my peeps!</i></p>
